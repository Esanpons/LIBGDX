# Jump Don't Die

This is a libGDX + Scene2D + Box2D prototype game. The code here will show you how to do an Android game using both Scene2D and Box2D at the same time. It is the code used in the YouTube tutorial series [_How to make Android games_ (_Cómo hacer un juego para Android_)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLraIUviMMM3duiko5MtkFPN2vhm0URmkE).
